To begin, choose the number of rounds and either customise 
the game parameters or go with the default game (where the
secret number will be between 1 and 100).

Then you must choose how many rounds you'd like to play, 
select <enter> for infinite mode.

Your end goal is to try to guess the 🔐secret🔐 number 
without running out of guesses.

Good luck player
